Things that need to be done
---------------------------

* Take json of TSS coordinates and pull RNA-seq data into TSS data
* Get list of splice coordinates
* Write machine learning fun stuff

Things Jeff is Working On
-------------------------

###Priority:###
* ~~GTF class~~ -- **DONE**
* Import GTF file -- **CAN DO**
* Filter GTF file for feature or attributes -- **HACKED/DONE**
* Produce a list of TSS coordinate in json format -- **IN PROGRESS**

###Other Things:###
* Package GTF utils into one file
* Documentation

Things Brian is Working On
--------------------------

###Priority###
* ~~Write first iteration of ChIP-Seq read count extraction~~ -- **DONE**
* Download additional ChIP-Seq Tag files -- **much check memory requirements**
* Update find_sites.py to take experiment ID and sample ID as command line argumentsand carry them into the output-- **~30 minutes of work**
* Write bash script to automate the running of this script once the TSS coordinates are available **CAN DO (pending run-time constraints)**
* update find_sites.py to take gene orientation into account -- **~ 10 minutes of work**
